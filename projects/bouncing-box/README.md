# Bouncing Box

We're going to create a simple game where a box moves across the screen at an increased speed after each click.

[When you are done it should look like this](http://jsbin.com/toyikozeyi/1/edit?output)

Our goal for this game is to learn how to bring together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We use HTML to define our structure, CSS to define the style of that structure, and JavaScript in order to implement behavior. One of the primary ways we can implement behavior in JavaScript is by making modifications to the HTML and CSS in response to **events** which we will demonstrate by making this simple game. 

### Take Away

* Introduction to principals of animation
* Introduction to cartesian coordinates
* Using JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements
* Using Variables to store data through the lifetime of a program
* Using `if` statements to conditionally make changes to the game
* Introduction to jQuery event handling

### Work Flow

For this program you will be given _**stencil code**_ found in the `index.html` file. This stencil will set up the program for you so that you can focus on the take aways of this project.

#### TODOs
To complete the assignment, below you'll find numbered **TODO** lesson steps.  While reading this lesson, whenever you come across a **TODO** step, you are expected to do this step, which may require you to create a file, or insert some HTML, CSS or JavaScript in the appropriate place.

Please follow the instructions closely. Sometimes, however, we may be showing you code examples to make a point, so you only need to add code if we're explicitly telling you to do a lesson step, so please be aware of the actual lesson steps.

#### Questions
Throughout this README you will find **QUESTIONs** asking you to think critically about the code that you are writing. Whenever you encounter a **QUESTION** add a comment starting with `//` answering the question like so:

    // QUESTION 1: After 50 milliseconds the position of the box will be 10

## Let's get started - installing bouncing box with `os install`
NOTE: If you receive an error that says, `os install command not found` the opspark CLI is not installed. To install it, enter the command `npm intall -g opspark` in your bash terminal. 

* Make sure your github and cloud9 accounts are linked to Greenlight
* Open your first website workspace
* go to your bash terminal (located at the bottom of the cloud9 workspace) and type in the command **os install**. Hit enter.
* If prompted, login with your github credentials
* Use your arrow keys to highlight your course and hit enter. hit enter again to confirm.
* Use your arrow keys to highlight bouncing-box and hit enter. hit enter again to confirm.
* open up the index.html file and press Run at the top of your workspace. You will be editing this file.

## A note about jQuery

We are going to be using [jQuery](https://jquery.com) for this exercise. You can see that we've included it in our web page with the following HTML 

    <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

jQuery is a powerful library which makes building web pages easier. It is also tremendously popular. If you are doing web development in 2015, you will likely run into jQuery. That is why we are introducing just a tiny bit of it here. 

You can recognize jQuery by its use of a very curious function `$()` Here is some of the jQuery code we use in this page:

    box = $('.box');
    boardWidth = $('.board').width();

## Lesson Steps

### TODO 1: Learn how to move the box

Within the `index.html` file, find the HTML for our box which has already been created for us:

    <body class="board">
      <div class="box">?</div>
    </body>

Now find the CSS that styles the box and change the following properties:

- `left`
- `top` 
- `width`
- `height`

Notice how you can change the appearance of the box using CSS! Now return those to their original values

    width: 70px;
    height: 70px;
    top: 100px;
    left: 0px;

### TODO 2: Create Variables to Track Game Changes

By changing the `left` and `top` CSS properties of the box we are able to make it move. Our goal is animate the box so that it moves across the screen - but we can't just keep manually changing the values of these properties.

Solution: Let's create some variables that we can program to change these properties as our game progresses. We'll need variables to keep track of all aspects of our game that are changing: The box's position, how fast it's moving, and how many times it has been clicked. 

Below `TODO 2` Declare and initialize `position` and `points` variables to zero and `speed` to 10

    // TODO 2
    var position;       // reference for the x-coordinate of our box
    var points;         // reference for the points displayed on the box
    var speed;          // reference for how fast the box moves

    position = 0;
    points = 0;
    speed = 10;
    
We will be using the following jQuery functions to make use of these changing variables. Add them below your new variables:
    
    box.css('left', position);      // changes the 'left' css property of the box to value of var position
    box.text(points);               // changes the text of the box to display the value of var points

The box.css() function changes the `left` css property of our box element to the value stored in `position`. Change the value of the `position` variable to `100` and watch the box move! The property is called "left" because it measures the distance from the left side of the screen. So, as we increase the value of `position`, the box will move to the right (and away from the left side of the screen).

The box.text() function changes the text content of our box element. Change the `points` variable and watch how it changes the points displayed.

Remember these functions - we'll be using them shortly!

Before we move on, lets reset those variables to their starting values

    position = 0;  
    points = 0;  
    speed = 10;

### TODO 3: Update the position of the box

You can create animation on a web page by changing the appearance of an object over time. A traditional animation is made up of individual "frames" of still images that change slightly over time. If you flip between these images rapidly the viewer sees the scene as motion (think of a flipbook!). 

We can do the same thing in programming by constantly changing the state of our program using a *function*. **A function is a reuseable block of code that performs some set of tasks**. If that function's task is to change the location of our box and we call upon it 20 times per second (20 FPS) then we can achieve animation! 

This requires 2 things: 

1) Create the function so that it repositions the box when called upon: The outline of the function has already been created for us and it is called `update`. Find the `update` function and inside of the curly braces add the following code below `// TODO 3 / 6 / 7 / 8`:

        position = position + speed;    // increase position on every update
        console.log("new position: " + position);
    
2) Call on the function 20 times/second: This is also already done for us! At the bottom of the program you will find the code `setInterval(update, 50);`. This special function instructs our `update` function to run every `50` milliseconds, which is 20 times per second! Each time the function is called the `position` variable will change and will be printed to the console.

**Run the program and open up the console in the new chrome tab (right click and choose inspect, then select the "console" tab). See how the value of position changes?**

**QUESTION 1: If this code happens every 50 milliseconds, what will the value of position be after 200 milliseconds?** 

### TODO 3 Part 2: Wait, it's not moving?!?!

Wait... isn't that supposed to make the box move? 

Well... not quite. We've told the computer to increase the value of the `position` variable on every update but we haven't told the computer move the box to this new position. We have to be *very* specific with our instructions.

Right below the code you just added, add the following code:

    box.css('left', position);      // set the 'left' CSS property of the box to the new value of position
    
Using the same jQuery function that we saw in TODO 2 we can make the box move to the new value of position. Since this code is also included in the `update` function, every time the position gets updated, so will the box's CSS.

We did it! We've achieved animation!

**Refresh your program and watch the box move!** 

## Take a break!

Now that we have achieved animation, go back and read through the first 3 **TODOs** and make sure that you understand how this program works so far. Ask an isntructor for help if you are still confused.

Then, stand up and take a 5 minute stretch break! You deserve it.


### TODO 4: Handling events

Our next goal is to make the box clickable. A click is an example of an event. Some other examples of **events** are:

- A timer going off
- The user hovers their mouse over an area.
- the web page has finished loading

JavaScript allows us to change the web page in response to **events**. The following code calls the `handleBoxClick` function every time the box is clicked. **(It's already there so you do not need to copy/paste this)**

    box.on('click', handleBoxClick);

`handleBoxClick` is just another function that performs another task. For this function, the first task it is responsible for is to keep track of how many times the user has clicked on the box by increasing the points variable by 1 and by updating the text displayed by the box.

Add the following code to the `handleBoxClick` function

     points = points + 1;   // increase the point total
     box.text(points);      // update the new points total displayed by the box
      
### TODO 5: Keeping Score

Every time the user clicks the box, we want to reset the box to its starting position and make the game harder by increasing the speed of the box. 

Add the following code to the `handleBoxClick` function just below the code from TODO 4:

      position = 0;         // reset the position of the box to 0
      speed = speed + 3;    // increase the speed of the box on every click

**QUESTION 2: If this code happens every time you click the box, what will the value of speed be after 3 clicks?** 

### TODO 6: Hey box, come back! Checking for boundaries

Each time we call the `update` function the position variable gets larger and larger until eventually our box has gone off the screen. The position of our box should never be greater than the width of the board which we've conveniently stored in a variable called `boardWidth` whose value is calculated using jQuery!

Let's get our box back on the screen `if` the `position` is greater than `boardWidth`. Add the following code **nested inside** the `update` function:

    if(position > boardWidth) {
        position = 0;
    }
    
Now on every update the game will check to see if the box has hit the right wall and if it has it will reset the box back to the left side of the screen. 

**But don't we want it to bounce instead of loop back to the start?** We will revisit this if block soon...


### TODO 7: Add Direction

Making the box "bounce" is simply providing the instructions, "When the box hits the right wall start moving left".

In the previous step we learned how to say, "When the box hits the right wall", but how do we tell the box to move left? 

Right now our motion comes from the following line in the `update` function:

    position = position + speed;
    
Since `speed` is positive, this code makes `position` increase and therefore move to the right. To make the box 
move the other way we need to make position smaller. Well, we could subtract speed instead of adding it but then we wouldn't be able to make the box move to the right anymore. Let's use a variable that we can switch to control the direction!

At the top of your program under `TODO 2` where the other variables are declared, declare a variable `direction`:

    var direction;
    direction = 1;
    
Now in the `update` function, replace the code that changes `position` so that it re-assigns the value of position like so:

    position = position + (speed * direction);
    
When `direction` is set to 1 then `speed` is added to position and the box moves to the right. But when `direction` is set to -1,the speed is subracted from the position, sending the box to the left. Now we need to decide when to change it!

### TODO 8: Make it Bounce

#### We need to decide when to change the direction: Conditionals!

In our `update` function we have this if statement to make sure our box doesn't go off the right side of the screen. It says: If the position of my box moves past the right side of the board, move my box back to position 0.

    if(position > boardWidth) {
        position = 0;
    }
    
 
We need to change this bounds-check so that instead of resetting the position of our box to 0 we change the direction to -1.
Do this and confirm that the box bounces off the right wall. It should look like this:

    if(position > boardWidth) {
        direction = -1;
    }
    
**Now  you'll need to make it bounce off the left wall. What will be the condition? What should happen if that condition is true? Do this yourself!**

Hint: At what position value do you want the box to "bounce" off the left wall?

## Good Job

You've written your first game! Here are some ways you can try and make your game even more awesome.

### Challenge 1) Use the [background-image](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp) CSS property to change your box or the background

### Challenge 2) Can you move the box up and down?
Hint: To calculate the height of the window, simply add:

    var boardHeight = $(window).height(); 

### Challenge 3) Can you make the box start at a random location on every click?

### Challenge 3) Can you make the box change color with each click? How about every 3 clicks?

### Challenge 5) Can you make the amount that the box speeds up with each click increase with every 3 clicks?

### Challenge 6) Can you make the game end if you mis-click 10 times?
